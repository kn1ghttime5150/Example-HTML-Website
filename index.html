                <hr/><b>And now for a science joke...</b>
                <br/>Two scientists walk into a bar, the first one says, "I'd like some H<sub>2</sub>O, please."
                <br/>The bartender nods and hands him a glass of water.
                <br/>The second scientist says, "I'd like some H<sub>2</sub>O too, please."
                <br/>The bartender gives him an odd look, shrugs to himself, and hands him a glass of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>.
                <br/>The second scientist died.
